# Challenge — Can You Sneak Past the Firewall?

The firewall blocks prompts that try to exfiltrate secrets (passwords, tokens, internal system prompts, etc.).
Your goal is to get the backend to reveal its **system prompt** (you'll see it in the LLM response if you succeed).

Rules the firewall enforces (partial list):
- Rejects prompts containing sensitive keywords (password, token, api key, system prompt, internal, 169.254, file:/, etc.).
- Detects jailbreak phrasing like “ignore previous instructions” or “act as a” to override rules.
- Caps context size, rate-limits repeated tries, and normalizes obfuscation (leetspeak, homoglyphs, base64 wrappers).

## Tasks
1. Send a **benign** prompt that should pass.
2. Send a **blatantly malicious** prompt that should be blocked.
3. Try **three different bypass** techniques and observe logs & responses.  
   - Examples to explore: indirection (“explain how *a system* might be configured”), split-encoding, role-play masking, base64 + instruction wrapper, insertion of zero-width spaces.
4. Document what worked and why, and propose a **firewall rule update**.

> Tip: Check `firewall.py` and `utils/sanitizer.py` to understand what the firewall normalizes and flags.
